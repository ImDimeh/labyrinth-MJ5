# The Sound Maze
(by Mathis NOEL, Mehdi BELLAM, Ryan BARDAT)

The goal is to move your character with.... your voice !!!

### The controls are the following:
- If you want to go to the right => Say "Right", loud and clear, in your microphone.
- If you want to go to the left => Say "Left", loud and clear, in your microphone.
- If you want to go to the up => Say "Up", loud and clear, in your microphone.
- If you want to go to the down => Say "Down", loud and clear, in your microphone.


### Have Fun !
